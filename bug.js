This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly integrated with React Native's lifecycle methods.  For example, if a library uses setInterval or setTimeout without proper cleanup in componentWillUnmount, it will continue running even after the component is unmounted, leading to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.  The error may not be immediately apparent, manifesting as strange crashes or performance issues.
